# Analysis

This is simply a test of my analysis fundamentals demonstrating my ability to pull data from the internet in the form of xlsx, convert it to CSV, 
upload those CSVs to MySQL, create a new table using the JOIN function in SQL, transfer my table from MySQL to tableau, and visualize my findings. 
Included in this repository are: Documentation, SQL JOIN Query, & Tableau Visuals
